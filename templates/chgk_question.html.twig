/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a node.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - node: Full node entity.
 *   - id: The node ID
 *   - bundle: The type of the node, for example, "page" or "article".
 *   - authorid: The user ID of the node author.
 *   - published: Whether the node is published.
 * - content: All node items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {% hide(content.field_example) %} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given element.
 * - question_url: Direct URL of the current node.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - chgk-question: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - node-[type]: The current node type. For example, if the node is a
 *     "Beskrylka" it would result in "chgk-question-beskrylka". 
 *   - view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the question; for example, a teaser
 *     would result in: "view-mode-teaser", and full: "view-mode-full".
 *   - preview: Whether a node is in preview mode.
 *   - unpublished: Appears on unpublished nodes visible only to site admins.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   node cannot hold the main body content.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * In field variables, each field instance attached to the node a corresponding
 * variable is defined; for example, 'node.body' becomes 'body'. When needing to
 * access a field's raw values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to
 * use these variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the
 * desired field language; for example, 'node.body.en', thus overriding any
 * language negotiation rule that may have been applied previously.
